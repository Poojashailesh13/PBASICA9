    "ans- An absolute path is a path that contains the entire path to the file or directory that you need to access. This path will begin at the home directory of your computer and will end with the file or directory that you wish to access. Absolute paths ensure that Python can find the exact file on your computer."

Every process running under an operating system has an associated working directory, which is called as the current working directory of the process. The current working directory of a process can be changed by calling the Python method os. chdir().chdir(\"path-to-dir\") : Short for CHange DIRectory, this function allows you to set the current working directory to a path of your choice.\n",
